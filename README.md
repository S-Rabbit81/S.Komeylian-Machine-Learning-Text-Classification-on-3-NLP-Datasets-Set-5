# Text classification pipelines using machine learning (Logistic Regression) on three datasets of 20 Newsgroups, IMDb Movie Reviews, and Cleaned SnappFood Persian Sentiment Analysis datasets #

######## 1. 
#### A summary of three methods, with key examples, is provided ####
# In summary: 
# Here, we investigate three methods for converting text into the numerics: 

# ***First Method: Tokenization: 
        # The process of breaking text into individual words or tokens, which both vectorizers rely on.

# ***Second Method: Count Vectorization: 
        # Converts text into a matrix where each column corresponds to a word, and each row corresponds to a document, with the value being the word count.

# ***Third Method: TF-IDF Vectorization: 
        # Normalizes the word counts by the document length to give a measure of how important a word is within a document.

        # First dataset:
                # First dataset: 20 Newsgroups dataset
                # https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/20-newsgroups #
                # Type of Dataset: Text Classification Dataset
                # Domain: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                # Data Type: Raw text documents (news articles, emails, discussions)
                # Language: English
                # Categories: 20 different topics, such as:
                                                # politics
                                                # religion
                                                # sports
                                                # computer hardware
                                                # science
                                                # automobiles, etc.
                # Supervised Learning: Each document has a label (0–19), indicating its topic.
                # In simple terms: It is a labeled text dataset commonly used for:
                                                # Text classification
                                                # Topic modeling
                                                # Document clustering
                                                # Feature extraction experiments (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, etc.)

        # Second dataset:
                # Second dataset: IMDb Movie Reviews dataset
                # https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
                # This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDb, labeled as positive or negative.
                # It is widely used for experiments in sentiment analysis and text classification in NLP.
                # The dataset provides a benchmark for building models that can classify text based on sentiment.
